## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

This project gave me a better understanding of position and how it helps in creating a mobile nav.

### Continued development

I will like to learn more on the usage of z-index.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://tutorialspoint.com) - This helped me with the creation of a curtain menu for mobile. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
